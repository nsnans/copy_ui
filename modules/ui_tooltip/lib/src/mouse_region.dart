/// A special [MouseRegion] that when nested, only the first [_ExclusiveMouseRegion]
/// to be hit in hit-testing order will be added to the BoxHitTestResult (i.e.,
/// child over parent, last sibling over first sibling).
///
/// The [onEnter] method will be called when a mouse pointer enters this
/// [MouseRegion], and there is no other [_ExclusiveMouseRegion]s obstructing
/// this [_ExclusiveMouseRegion] from receiving the events. This includes the
/// case where the mouse cursor stays within the paint bounds of an outer
/// [_ExclusiveMouseRegion], but moves outside of the bounds of the inner
/// [_ExclusiveMouseRegion] that was initially blocking the outer widget.
///
/// Likewise, [onExit] is called when the a mouse pointer moves out of the paint
/// bounds of this widget, or moves into another [_ExclusiveMouseRegion] that
/// overlaps this widget in hit-testing order.
///
/// This widget doesn't affect [MouseRegion]s that aren't [_ExclusiveMouseRegion]s,
/// or other [HitTestTarget]s in the tree.
